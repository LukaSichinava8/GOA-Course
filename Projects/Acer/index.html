        <h1 id="acer">Acer</h1>

        <p class="info">Acer is a Taiwanese multinational hardware and electronics corporation specializing in advanced electronics technology,<br> headquartered in Xizhi, New Taipei City. Its products include desktop PCs, laptops
        <br>tablets, servers, storage devices, virtual reality devices, displays, smartphones and peripherals, as well as gaming PCs and accessories under its Predator brand. Acer is the world's 6th-largest PC vendor by unit sales as of September 2022.<br>
        In the early 2000s, Acer implemented a new business model, shifting from a manufacturer to a designer, marketer, and distributor of products, while performing production processes via contract manufacturers.<br>
        Currently, in addition to its core IT products business, Acer also has a new business entity that focuses on the integration of cloud services and platforms, and the development of smartphones and wearable devices with value-added IoT applications.</p>
