            <p>In the main course of GOA programming, you will learn full-stack web development, and in the last stage, you will also take courses in artificial intelligence and data analysis (with Python).</p>
            <p>In short, you'll be guaranteed $200,000 a year in the 2030s.</p>
            <p>developing a full-stack web application requires a combination of front-end, back-end, database, and AI development skills. By using React, Django, MySQL, and AI, you can create a powerful web application with a rich user interface, robust back-end functionality, and the ability to generate insights from data using machine learning and data analysis.</p>
