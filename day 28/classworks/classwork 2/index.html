      <p class="box">Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas,<br> Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa,<br> is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts during the late evening and overnight hours on Christmas Eve.<br>He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his North Pole workshop,<br>and with the aid of flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.<br>
      The modern figure of Santa is based on folklore traditions surrounding Saint Nicholas, the English figure of Father Christmas,<br> the German Belsnickel and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas.Santa is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs, white-fur-cuffed red trousers, a red hat trimmed with white fur, a black leather belt and boots, carrying a bag full of gifts for children. He is popularly associated with a deep, hearty laugh, frequently rendered in Christmas literature as "ho, ho, ho!"</p>
